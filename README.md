# Desktop for Google Keep

**A quick cross-platform app to view Google Keep as a desktop app**

Very simple. Based heavily from the electron-quick-start app https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start/
Requires node.js https://github.com/nodejs and Electron https://github.com/electron/

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Run

```sh
npm start
```

## Build

Build the application for specified platform:

```sh
npm run build:darwin
npm run build:linux
npm run build:windows
```

Final app size is around 110MB and that is insane considering what this app does and it's source size but apparently this is a thing with Electron.
