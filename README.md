# Google Keep Desktop

**A quick cross-platform app to view Google Keep as a desktop app**

Very simple. Based heavily from the [electron-quick-start-app](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start/).
Requires [node.js](https://github.com/nodejs) and [Electron](https://github.com/electron/).

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Run

```sh
npm start
```

## Build

Build the application for specified platform:

```sh
npm run build:darwin
npm run build:linux
npm run build:windows
```

If you use a Mac, you should also check out this [ever so slightly more efficient app I wrote using MacGap](https://github.com/chriskol/Desktop-Google-Keep-OSX).
